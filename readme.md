# Share Your Salary

"Share Your Salary" is a web applicaion that enables users to create anonymous salary surveys and then invite ohers to participate. The application leverages the following technologies:
  - [Fat Free Framework](http://fatfreeframework.com/) for page templating and API routes
  - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for posting data to APIs
  - [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/) for documenting and testing the API
  - [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as the database backend
  - [OpenShift](http://openshift.com/) for hosting, loadbalancing, DNS, and application deployment

This application was created mainly as an excuse to experiment with new tools and platforms. You are free to use this application under the MIT license (basically, give me some credit and you can do whatever you want with it).
